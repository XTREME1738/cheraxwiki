## Cherax Wiki

Cherax Wiki is a fan‑made documentation site for the GTA V mod menu **Cherax**.  
It’s built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) and is meant to collect tutorials, guides, and references in one place.

> **Note:** This is a "just for fun" website made for helping out people, not as a profit or similar, the only funds I will be taking from this is non-forced donations to help upkeep the site.
